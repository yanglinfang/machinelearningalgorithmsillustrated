						<p>So far we've looked at a couple of toy examples, and gotten some idea of the basic mechanics of a network. <span class="larger">So what does a model on a real problem look like?</span> If we think of our model in terms of its parameters, here is what those parameters "look like". We demonstrate the model weights as they are updated during training. The first layer contains 784 rows corresponding to the input size of our data, a 28 x 28 pixel image (flattened to 1 x 784), and user specified number of columns.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>
						In this first hidden layer, you can hover over the boxes and see the corresponding pixel position in an image. The weights start out with some random values, but as the model trains, you can actually see that some pixel positions are less important than others. In particular, the edge pixels carry very little weight. This is to be expected, as the pixels around the edges of the MNIST digits are mostly white.
						</p><p>
						If the subsequent hidden layers are of different dimensions than our inputs, then you can no longer make those direct comparisons. Hence the 'black box' effect - or in other words, there is no clear way to interpret the model past the first set of weights (Logistic Regression).
